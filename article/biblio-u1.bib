 abstract = {A new method for analysing nonlinear and non-stationary data has been developed. The key part of the method is the 'empirical mode decomposition' method with which any complicated data set can be decomposed into a finite and often small number of 'intrinsic mode functions' that admit well-behaved Hilbert transforms. This decomposition method is adaptive, and, therefore, highly efficient. Since the decomposition is based on the local characteristic time scale of the data, it is applicable to nonlinear and non-stationary processes. With the Hilbert transform, the 'instrinic mode functions' yield instantaneous frequencies as functions of time that give sharp identifications of imbedded structures. The final presentation of the results is an energy-frequency-time distribution, designated as the Hilbert spectrum. In this method, the main conceptual innovations are the introduction of 'intrinsic mode functions' based on local properties of the signal, which makes the instantaneous frequency meaningful; and the introduction of the instantaneous frequencies for complicated data sets, which eliminate the need for spurious harmonics to represent nonlinear and non-stationary signals. Examples from the numerical results of the classical nonlinear equation systems and data representing natural phenomena are given to demonstrate the power of this new method. Classical nonlinear system data are especially interesting, for they serve to illustrate the roles played by the nonlinear and non-stationary effects in the energy-frequency-time distribution.},

Monthly sunspot number data from 1749 to 2010 were analyzed using this technique, which revealed the different variability inherent in the data including the 11-year (Schwabe), 20{\thinspace}--{\thinspace}50-year (quasi-Hale) and 60{\thinspace}--{\thinspace}120-year (Gleissberg) cycles. The results were compared with traditional Fourier analysis. The Hilbert{\thinspace}--{\thinspace}Huang transform is able to provide a local and adaptive description of the intrinsic cyclic components of sunspot number data, which are nonstationary and which are the result of nonlinear processes.",

	abstract = {We explore the similarity and difference of the quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) observed in the decay phase of solar and stellar flares at X-rays. We identified 42 solar flares with pronounced QPPs, observed with RHESSI, and 36 stellar flares with QPPs, observed with XMM-Newton. The empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method and least-squares fit by a damped sine function were applied to obtain the periods (P) and damping times (τ) of the QPPs. We found that (1) the periods and damping times of the stellar QPPs are 16.21 ± 15.86 minutes and 27.21 ± 28.73 minutes, while those of the solar QPPs are 0.90 ± 0.56 and 1.53 ± 1.10 minutes, respectively; (2) the ratios of the damping times to the periods () observed in the stellar QPPs (1.69 ± 0.56) are statistically identical to those of solar QPPs (1.74 ± 0.77); and (3) the scalings of the QPP damping time with the period are well described by the power law in both solar and stellar cases. The power indices of the solar and stellar QPPs are 0.96 ± 0.10 and , respectively. This scaling is consistent with the scalings found for standing slow magnetoacoustic and kink modes in solar coronal loops. Thus, we propose that the underlying mechanism responsible for the stellar QPPs is the natural magnetohydrodynamic oscillation in the flaring or adjacent coronal loops, as in the case of solar flares.}
